Rules
  cards have their own value
    ace = 1 or 11 (player chooses)
    2 = 2
    3 = 3
    4 = 4 
    5 = 5 
    6 = 6 
    7 = 7 
    8 = 8 
    9 = 9
    10 = 10
    Jack = 10
    Queen = 10 
    King = 10
  The point of the game is to get your cards to add up to 21 or less. 
  If you go higher then 21 you "bust" and automatically lose
  If you get 21 then you automatically win unless the other player(s) also get 21

Game Play
  Dealer deals out 2 cards to each player, one card faced up one card faced down
  The Player then decides wheather he wants to "hit me", gain a card, or "stay", sitck with the two card they already have. They do this based on the card that is faced up.
  You does this all with one card still faced down
  Once they have decided to "stay" the card faced down will now be turned over 
  All cards you have will now be added together
  Whoever gets closest to 21 or gets 21 then they win
  If you go higher then 21 you "bust" and automatically lose
  
  replay until game is over 
  
  Be more clear on whether the new card is faced up or faced down
